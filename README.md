## 1. Before you begin

- Read all documentation and inform lead developer of any unclear instructions before started working on the project
- Time duration for project completion is **1 week**
- Daily communication with lead developer is required to update progress
- Add progress to Slack channel **( practices )**  every day with these defined points:
    - What was done today?
    - What will be done tomorrow?
    - Any hurdles encountered during the day?
- Although the lead developer is available for assistance, it is recommended that you try to resolve issues independently prior to seeking support to optimize time utilization for all.
- Use resources like Google, official documentation of framework, library to help find solutions.
- to speed up development  on the frontend and your own learning , itâ€™s recommended to use:
    - Tailwind css alternative to regular css
    - framework like Mantine, Bootstrap or Material UI which you thinkâ€™s best.
- Google Luck with your project ðŸ™‚

## **3. Introduction**

This is a MERN stack web application that includes a JWT-based authentication system and a user database. Users can sign up, sign in, and update their profiles, which include various user information. The app has four pages, and only authenticated users can access the user list page. User profile pictures are stored in S3, and the project includes a search bar for users to find other users. The UI is user-friendly, with form validation and alerts for successes and failures. The app maintains the user's authentication state after page reloads.

## 4. **Pages**

- root
- sign-in
- signup
- path:Â `/`

- The project should contain user information, including first name, last name, email, password, date of birth, gender, occupation, bio, and profile picture.
- A user should be considered active if they have logged in within the last hour.
- The project should include the following pages: root, sign-in, signup, and user list.

- Upon signing up or logging in, the user should be redirected to the user list page where they can view all active users.
- If an unauthenticated user attempts to access the user list page, they should be redirected to the root page to sign-up or login.
- Logging out should redirect the user to the login page.
- User profile pictures should be stored in S3 using pre-signed URLs.

## 5. **Bonus Criteria**

- designing as close as [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/LiRYkD8F6rq428x2kK6r6X/PROJECT-1.0?node-id=0%3A1)
- The project should implementÂ **role-based access control**, allowing different levels of access for different types of users (e.g., admin vs regular user).
    - Admin - can search and delete normal users
- The project should allow users toÂ **sign in with their social media accounts**.
